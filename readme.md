This repo contains the getSTEM Kinect 3D app that was used at the 
Minnesota High Tech Association tent at the 2011 Minnesota State Fair.

This app was conceived and developed by Eric Raarup and Mike Hodnick (respectively).

This app has a dependency on the Ab3d 3dsReader:

Most of this application is based off of Mike's initial Kinect/WPF-3D work found here:
